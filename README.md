# Academia

**This is a capstone project required by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/), after finishing a big section of a technical curriculum related to Rails, they have choose this project for me to prove my technical knowledge, you can find the requirement [here](https://www.notion.so/Twitter-redesign-f8a8d48453d54d1a949bb0ceab4c8718)**

> Academia is the most efficient application that you can add to your school to keep your students updated with you school's news, and prevent them from wasting time on social media platforms, instead of that they can use Academia to contact each other and share the latest news about there class and school, in order to use the platform you will need a proper sign up with an email, avatar and cover picture. when you log in you will get redirected to the home page where you can see your own and your following posts at any moment you can click on a user profile image or name to get redirected to his profile if you want to start a conversation with him you will need to click on the message icon next to his profile image.

### Prerequisites

Ruby v2.6.5, Rails v6.0.3.2, Postgres: >=9.5

### Setup

install gems with

```
bundle install
```

Setup database with:

```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```



## IMPORTANT

**I used S3 AWS service in order to store images. Therefore, I used SECRET KEYS stored in environment variables on my development and production servers.**

- So if you have AWS credentials create a file an application.yml file inside config/ and put this your credentials in it like showing bellow:

```ruby
  development:
    access_key_id: your_access_key_id_goes_here
    secret_access_key: your_secrect_access_key_goes_here
```

### Run Tests

To run tests you can easily go to the root of the project and then run the following command:

```
rspec
```

You can also add your own test cases on the `/spec` directory.

### Usage

Start server with:

```
rails s
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser
